# Monterey Flipper Pinball Standings Projections

## Purpose
This notebook is used to project the final standings of the Monterey Flipper Pinball league.
The highest 5 weekly scores for each player are summed at the end of the season to produce a winner.
There are 10 weeks total, so you can drop up to 5 scores if you attend every week.

## TODO
- Possibly redo converting the json to a dataframe, there has to be a better way
- compute_required_avg works now before week 9, but needs to be fixed for earlier weeks
