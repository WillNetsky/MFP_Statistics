# Monterey Flipper Pinball Standings Projections

## Purpose
This notebook is used to project the final standings of the Monterey Flipper Pinball league.
The highest 5 weekly scores for each player are summed at the end of the season to produce a winner.
There are 10 weeks total, so you can drop up to 5 scores if you attend every week.

As of right now it is the end of week 4, my initial idea is to take your average score and use that to replace any lower scores, as well as the correct number of future weeks.

## TODO
- Possibly redo converting the json to a dataframe, there has to be a better way
